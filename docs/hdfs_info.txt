Options (= is mandatory):

- auth
        Define account to impersonate to perform required operation. Technically, this value will be inserted between the path
        and the `op=XXXXX' value of the built URL. Refer to `https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-
        hdfs/WebHDFS.html#Authentication' for more information.
        [Default: user.name=hdfs]
- hadoop_conf_dir
        Where to find Haddop configuration file, specially hdfs-site.xml, in order to lookup WebHDFS endpoint (`dfs.namenode
        .http-address') Used only if webhdfs_endpoint is not defined
        [Default: /etc/hadoop/conf]
= hdfs_path
        HDFS path to the file being managed.  Aliases: `dest', `name'
        [Default: None]
- webhdfs_endpoint
        Provide WebHDFS REST API entry point. Typically `<namenodeHost>:50070'. If not defined, will be looked up in local hdfs-
        site.xml
        [Default: None]
Notes:
  * As HDFS is a distributed file system shared by all nodes of a cluster, this module must be launched on one node only.
        Note there is no protection against race condition (Same operation performed simultaneously from several nodes).
  * All HDFS operations are performed using WebHDFS REST API.
